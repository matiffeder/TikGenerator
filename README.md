This project was made for CIA Downloader.

Put encTitleKeys.bin in the same directory of TikGenerator.exe.<br />
Find title ID of the game for cetk which you want to generate.<br />

Then run command:
```
TikGenerator.exe <Title ID>
```
or
```
TikGenerator.exe <Title ID> <tmd location>
```

<br />

Exapmple:
```
TikGenerator.exe 00040000000EE000
```
or
```
TikGenerator.exe 00040000000EE000 00040000000EE000/tmd
```

<br />

If there is no tmd location, the title version in cetk will be 0.<br />
The title version is not really important for making rom.<br />
